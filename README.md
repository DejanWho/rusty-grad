# Rusty-Grad

## Introduction
Welcome to "rusty-grad", a personal project created to explore the fascinating intersection of Rust programming and Machine Learning (ML). This project is designed as a learning pathway for diving deep into the nuances of Rust language and the practical applications of ML.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of "rusty-grad" is to serve as a learning platform. Through this project, I aim to:
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of Rust, a language known for its performance and safety.
- Explore Machine Learning concepts and apply them in a Rust-based environment.
- Develop a series of ML models and tools using Rust, thereby understanding the synergy between advanced programming and AI.

## Learning Path
As a part of this journey, "rusty-grad" will encompass various stages:
- **Foundation in Rust**: Building a solid base in Rust programming by implementing fundamental concepts.
- **ML Basics**: Understanding the core principles of Machine Learning and how they can be applied in Rust.
- **Project Development**: Creating specific ML models and tools, gradually increasing in complexity.

## Personal Project Disclaimer
It's important to note that "rusty-grad" is a personal project, primarily aimed at my learning and development in Rust and Machine Learning. As such, the focus is on educational growth rather than creating a production-ready tool.

## Contribution
While this is a personal learning project, input and suggestions from the Rust and ML communities are always welcome. If you have ideas, advice, or feedback, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
